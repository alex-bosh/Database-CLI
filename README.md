## Project Setup
1.	Download the PostgreSQL database from the GitHub link above, connect to a SQL Server (PostgreSQL recommended), and import the database to your server.\
2.	Download the Python file and open it in a Python interpreter (Visual Studio Code recommended). Some packages will have to be installed, which are listed below:\
      o	Numpy\
      o	Psycopg2\
4.	After these packages are installed, the CLI program is ready to run! Be sure that you are connected to your database server. Near the top of the main file are fields for the server credentials. These are set to default values but change them accordingly if needed.\
5.	Run the program and feel free to make decisions based on the prompts you are given in the terminal.\
